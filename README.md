# baking-app
An app that shows baking videos for different recipes

### Baking App

* Use of Exoplayer to show videos
* Every thing is using fragments. Thus easier to utilize in master-slave view to support tablets.
* Multiple consecutive API calls, Data Parsing and Handling (multiple recycler views)
* Lambda Functions to optimize code and take advantage of Java 8
* Singleton Pattern
* Dependency Injection (Butterknife, also used in previous project)
* Card Views
* Using Volley to check cache and use it (no need to make futile internet calls everytime)
* Use of parcelable to transfer data with Intents
